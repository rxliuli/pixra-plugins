# Gemini Watermark Remover

A Pixra plugin that removes the semi-transparent Gemini AI watermark from generated images.

## Problem

Images generated by Google Gemini AI have a small four-pointed star watermark in the bottom-right corner. It's a white overlay with ~50% opacity, making the underlying pixels brighter. This plugin reverses the alpha blending to recover the original pixels.

## Usage

1. Open a Gemini-generated image in Pixra
2. Run "Remove Gemini Watermark" from the Tools menu
3. The watermark area is restored in-place

## How it works

The plugin uses reverse alpha blending to recover original pixel values:

1. A pre-extracted alpha map of the Gemini watermark is embedded as a base64 PNG
2. The watermark position is calculated based on image dimensions:
   - Normal images (max dimension ≤ 2000px): 48x48 watermark, 32px from edges
   - Large images (max dimension > 2000px): 96x96 watermark, 64px from edges
3. For each watermark pixel: `original = (current - 255 × alpha) / (1 - alpha)`

## Install

1. Open <https://pixra.rxliuli.com/>
2. Click **Plugin** > **Plugin Store**
3. Find "Gemini Watermark Remover" and install it
